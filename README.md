# 📘 Object-Oriented Programming in Python – Practice Projects

This repository contains beginner-friendly Python projects demonstrating the concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using classes and objects. Each project focuses on real-world examples to strengthen understanding of encapsulation, abstraction, and method implementation.

# 🚀 Projects Included
1️⃣ Rectangle Class

A simple class to represent a rectangle with:

Perimeter() → Calculates the perimeter

Area() → Calculates the area

display() → Displays all details (length, width, perimeter, and area)

# 2️⃣ BankAccount Class

Methods:

Deposit() → Adds money to the account

Withdrawal() → Withdraws money safely

bankFees() → Deducts 5% fee from the balance

display() → Displays account details

# 3️⃣ FlashCard Class

A memory-aid tool implemented using Python classes:

Uses a dictionary of fruits and their colors

Randomly generates flashcards using the random module

Helps test knowledge in a fun and interactive way

Example: "What is the color of Banana?" → Answer: Yellow
